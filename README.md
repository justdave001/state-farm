# 2023 State Farm Coding Competition - NodeJS JavaScript Version

## Welcome

This is the stub project for the 2023 State Farm Coding Competition Round 1 in NodeJS JavaScript. This will be the same project you'll use once Round 1 begins.

Once Round 1 begins, we'll add the problem statement and the actual JSON files and unit tests you'll be using.

## Setup

### Pre-Req

- Node.js - version 18 or higher
- npm (comes with Node.js) - version 8 or higher
- Jest (for testing) - version 28 or higher

#### Node.js

We recommend downloading the LTS version of Node.js from the official website.

- [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/)

#### Jest

You can install Jest using the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

#### Git and VSCode

For setting up Git and VSCode, please see [the overall README.md](../README.md).

#### VSCode Extensions

When you open this folder up in VSCode, you should see a dialog box open in the bottom-right hand corner of your screen. We've added several extensions that should help you spend less time on your environment, syntax, and manual work and more time on working on the problem statement.

You can view this file in `.vscode/extensions.json`.

## Run

To test this project:

```sh
npm test
```

In VSCode, you can also run the unit tests by clicking on the play button beside each test when you open the test file.

For more information on testing with Jest, see the official Jest documentation - [Getting Started with Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).

**Note: Use this functionality for quick and easy testing, but, before you turn your submission in, please attempt to run the `npm test` command at least once to determine how many unit tests have been passed.**

## Installing Additional Packages

To install additional packages, follow [this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-locally). You can also search around the Internet for more guidance.
